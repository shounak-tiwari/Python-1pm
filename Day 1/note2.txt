2. scriptive mode : multiple line codes which is execute by pressing f5  
		->are you want to save this code : yes / no
		->if user press yes it ask the name of file ----for example hello.py
		->press enter and your file is compile and execute line by line beacuse python is a interpreter programming language   
for writting python code in scriptive mode : 
open scriptive mode or use any text editor e.g notepad , text editor ,
-> Python code execute using idle (intergrated development of learning enviroment )
	1. open idle 
	2. press control + n for open script mode 
	3. simple write python code 
			print("Hello ! Daimand Batch")
	4. for saving and execute press f5 (laptop ->fn+f5)

	6. save file after it will automatically execute and compile both 
-> python code execute using text editor : 
	1. open text editor 
	2. write python code 
 	3. save this code press control+s 
	4. for saving source code file select location and give the name (e.g akash.py) 
	5. open command prompt or terminal in same location and write command for execute python source code 
		windows operating system
